flacthis
========

A multithreaded and multi-platform, BSD-licensed, Python-based command line utility that converts
lossless FLAC or WAV audio files to MP3s, AAC, or Ogg and preserves the directory structure.

I created this when I didn't want to use the Mono libraries needed to use
 other alternatives and wanted something easy to run in a cronjob.
 
This has been designed to be as modular as possible. Any type of codec that supports
 writing to/from stdin/out can be added with minimal effort. I've supported the majority
 of mainstream codecs, but if there are others you want added, please email me!
 
NOTE: No files or directories will ever be deleted. Only new directories and
 files are created. The purpose of this utility is to be able to run it on a regular
 basis and only needing to encode new content. 

Installation
------
Install `flacthis` from [Github](http://www.github.com) using git:
    
    git clone https://github.com/precurse/flacthis.git
    
Install module requirements using [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/), a
package manager for Python.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Need pip? Try installing it by running the following from the command
line:

    $ curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python


Command Line Usage
------

	usage: flacthis.py [-h] [-i {flac,wav,winwav}]
	                   [-o {mp3,ogg,aac,avconv-fdkaac,ffmpeg-fdkaac}] [-t THREADS]
	                   [--noid3] [--debug]
	                   source_dir dest_dir
	
	positional arguments:
	  source_dir            Input (lossless) directory
	  dest_dir              Output (lossy) directory
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -i {flac,wav,winwav}, --input_codec {flac,wav,winwav}
	                        Input (lossless) codec (default: flac)
	  -o {mp3,ogg,aac,avconv-fdkaac,ffmpeg-fdkaac}, --output_codec {mp3,ogg,aac,avconv-fdkaac,ffmpeg-fdkaac}
	                        Output (lossy) codec (default: mp3)
	  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
	                        Force specific number of threads (default: auto)
	  --noid3               Disable ID3 file tagging (remove requirement for
	                        Mutagen)
	  --debug               Enable debugging

    
Module Import Usage
------
When importing `flacthis` as a module into your existing codebase the module requires, at minimum, the 
source and destination directories.  You can pass these directly to the constructor (see the code below).

```python
import flacthis

ft = flacthis.main(['source_dir', 'dest_dir'])
```

If you wish to use optional arguments like `--input-codec`, you must maintain the positional directory arguments as
shown below:

```python
import flacthis

ft = flacthis.main(['i', 'flac', 'o', 'mp3', '--debug', 'source_dir', 'dest_dir'])
```

Supported Codecs
--------------

  Codec:  (Command used)
* FLAC decoder: (flac)

* WAV decoder: ('cat' in *nix and 'type' in Windows)

* MP3 encoder: (lame)

* AAC encoder: (faac)

* ffmpeg or libav encoder for Fraunhofer AAC support: (ffmpeg or avconv)
	+ Fraunhofer codec: http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencore-amr/files/fdk-aac/
	+ Both must be compiled with "--enable-libfdk-aac".

* Ogg encoder: (oggenc)

Most of these can be downloaded easily from rarewares.org on Windows, or installed from
 your friendly neighbourhood package manager (Linux, BSD).

Requirements
-------------

* Python2 (tested on 2.7.5)

* A supported decoder from above list

* A supported encoder from above list

* Mutagen Python Library (Optional, but highly recommended)
    + Used for ID3 tagging, but requirement can be disabled with --noid3 flag
	+ http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/
